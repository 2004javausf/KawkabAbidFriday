Inheritance
	
	when a programming language language allows for a hierarchy of object
	Child objects obtain states and behavior from parent objects.
	Multiple inheritance?? NO! ( kinda yes with interfaces)
	
	**Diamond problem**
	
Encapsulation
	
	when you wrap and protect data fields, protect data fields, preventing manipulation outside of the class
	Usually require getter and setter method to change these value
	Conceal internal state of object. Preserving integrity

Polymorphsim

	the ability for the programming language to be able to tell the difference between object and methods of same name with different variable/class 
types	
	Overriding - same name, same parameters, different behavior.
	Overloading - same name, different parameter, different behavior.
	Yes, many forms- :/
	Multiple "is-a" relationship
	Object>Animal>Cat
	Animal IS-a Animal, and also and Object
	Cat is a cat, animal and object
	Coveriance
	
Abstraction
	sometimes omitted from pilliars of OOP
	Hiding the implementation details
	"What it does, NOT how it does it"
	Expsosing only functionality
	Abstract class - abstract methods have no implementation
