Polymorphism Overloading: order of Operations
1. Exact Match
2. Conversion - Primitives/Objects that cast themselves into other types (primitive to primitives && object to object)
3. Un/Boxing - Going from primitive to object or vice versa
4. Varagrs - arguments wrapped into arrays
		
		foo(int ... args){
			//logic	
		}

		foo(a, b, c, d, e) -> args[] = {a,b,c,d,e}
