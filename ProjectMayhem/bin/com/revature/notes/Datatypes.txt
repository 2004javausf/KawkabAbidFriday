in Java, we have primitive and reference type
Primmitive - 8 just value
	char 
	boolean
	byte
	short
	int
	long
	float
	double
	**look up bit size**
Reference - an object; more than just a value

Java is a passes by value
it passes the value of reference rather than the reference themselves.
Numeric type conversions
	**look out for loss of precision
